# COSC-578-Project
Library Management Database System

Towson University, Baltimore’s largest university, is home to the Albert S. Cook Library. The library provides the student body with resources, services, and study spaces that the academic community needs to further their education. At the heart of Towson University’s campus, Cook Library has over 500,000 print and digital texts that the students, faculty, and community can access either at the library or online. 
	With the mission of transforming learning by empowering the community to discover, engage, and create, Cook Library caters to the student body efficiently by dividing its resources into six departments. Our focus will center on the Research and Instruction department. The Research and Instruction department offers support to students via student-scheduled meetings where the department’s staff can offer solutions and new perspectives on issues and offer instructional support in classrooms, among other methods. 
	After meeting with Elisabeth White, we identified a few issues with their current system regarding inaccurate internal reporting. Our group will attempt to solve these issues from our planning phase by implementing a scaled-down version of the Research and Instructional department’s database built with SQL and Java. From our database, we will have complete control over how internal reporting will be conducted and can offer our solutions to Cook Library as a remedy to their issues.
